			<p> Back in 1964, if you wanted something quick, you’d better have liked burgers. Leroy and Forrest Raffel, had a taste for something different. So they opened a sandwich shop that served up hot, freshly sliced roast beef sandwiches as fast as anyone could flip a burger. Our all beef classic roast beef has been prepared and marinated the same way since 1971. Fifty years of serving the meats. And we've enjoyed every minute of it. Over the past 50 years we've built up quite a fan base of meat lovers, and in the next 50 we'll continue to give them what they want: quality meat sandwiches with fast and friendly service.</p>
